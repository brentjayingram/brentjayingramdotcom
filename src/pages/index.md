      I'm a programmer who actually CAN fix your computer. 

      I've been a part of the IT industry for the past 7 years. About 4 years ago I worked in a website development company and that is where I was exposed to the world of building websites, and I caught the bug (and caused a few along the way). 

      I specialize in ReactJS.
